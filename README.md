# VirtualDeck
A virtual deck of cards meant for playtesting paper prototypes without paper

The library of cards are generated by editing the EXCEL document (Cards.xlsx)

The xlsx document functions as a database for the application.   The first page defines the library of cards, the second page defines the number of copies in each deck (cards are referenced by their name).
